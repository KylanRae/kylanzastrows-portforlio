      <p>This brochure was one of the projects for marks we did after the practice. The requirements were to use; all of the supplied text and at least one of the supplied logos.

      <p>This brochure was our first-page layout for the class. The requirements were to use; the supplied text, at least two of the supplied images and use both of the supplied logos. We received lots of feedback from our teacher and was encouraged to do so for success. The unfolded brochure was 11"x8.5" at 300ppi and folded as either a Z-fold or a Tri-fold. I chose to do the Tri-fold setup.</p>

      <h6>GRPH 150 | Design 1 | Performance Exam (Printed Piece Portion)</h6>
      <a href="images/page_design/pykspostcard1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="postimage" src="images/page_design/pykspostcard1.jpg" alt="Pyks postcard front"></a>
      <a href="images/page_design/pykspostcard2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="postimage" src="images/page_design/pykspostcard2.jpg" alt="Pyks postcard back"></a>
      <p>The postcard above was for my design 1 class during the second term of my first semester in my first year in Graphic Communications. Our performance exam consisted of making a logo for one of the four prompts of our choosing. I chose the recording studio option. For that option, we have complete creative freedom, but we were only allowed to design in greyscale, to reduce costs. This piece was the advertising piece that would be left in music stores across Canada to promote their new recording studio.</p>

      <h6>GRPH 147 | Digital Page Layout 1 | Performance Test: Newsletter</h6>
      <a href="images/page_design/newsletter.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="postimage" src="images/page_design/newsletter.jpg" alt="newsletter front"></a>
      <a href="images/page_design/newsletter2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="postimage" src="images/page_design/newsletter2.jpg" alt="newsletter back"></a>
      <p>The newsletter above was my first attempt at doing any creative page layout for my first-page layout assignment. This specific assignment was during the first term of my first semester in my first year of Graphic Communications. Our task was to design a newsletter talking about a particular day in history, our birthday. We had to research things that happened that day, and the year we were born. The specifications were that we have two pages, a minimum of 2 columns on each page and must have two master pages, an A-Master and a B-Master.</p>
